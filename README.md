# Seam Carving

Unfinished seam carving implementation. Currently, it is set to automatically load the Wikipedia Seam Carving image on page load, then upon click, perform seam carving, and then finally re-draw the image's "energy" back to the screen. It shouldn't be too hard to add the seam culling from here. I just haven't done it yet ðŸ™ˆ
